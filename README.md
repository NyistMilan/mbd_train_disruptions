# MBD Train Disruptions

This is the final assignment for the UTwente cource Managing Big Data proposed by group 17.

## Research Questions

What factors drive delays in the Dutch railway system, and to what extent can these disruption causes be better understood by integrating external data (e.g., weather)?

- How strongly do weather conditions (rain, wind, temperature, etc.) correlate with delay frequency?

- How do delay patterns vary across train types, providers, or neighboring countries?

- How do delays differ across time (rush hours, seasons, years)?


## Datasets Used
